# Key networking concepts and terms
At the core of the java's networking support is the concept of sockets. 
Sockets allows a single computer to serve many different clients at once.
This is accomplished through the use of PORT, which is a numbered socket 
on a particular machine. A server process is said to "listen" to a port until 
a client connects to it
<br/>
_Socket communication_ takes place via a protocol <br/>
- **IP** (low level routing protocol)
- **TCP** Higher level protocol
- **UDP** third party protocol
